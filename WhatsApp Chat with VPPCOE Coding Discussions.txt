I'm Ashutosh Yadav, a Web3 enthusiast, and a Frontend Developer, with 2+ years of experience in Freelancing, and have been providing case studies, and web solutions, to the amazing creators, and entrepreneurs out there.  

Let's learn, connect and grow together !!!

10/09/22, 19:14 - +91 81087 32316: @919850582847, how to approach such bitwise problem?
10/09/22, 19:34 - Tejas Warambhe Clg Coder CP: This uses bit masking concept with combinatorics
We know the property of bitwise OR i.e
In P | Q if any bit is set in either of the numbers the result will also have that bit set

Now observe the problem 
We run a bit mask from 0th bit to 20th bit (as per given in constraints)
If in P Q R have all bit set to 0
Then answer would be 1 because the numbers would be zeros which gives only 1 way to choose from 3 numbers 

If bit is set in all numbers
Then we would be using NCR (3C2) to choose pair

If exactly one bit is set, then answer is 0 because numbers are made simultaneously as per previous number which means a set bit is ought to set the bit of corresponding next number.

For other cases answer is 1 
Why?(try on paper üòÖ I just have intuition)
10/09/22, 19:36 - Tejas Warambhe Clg Coder CP: 3C2 = 3 
And let‚Äôs add 1 to it as a general case of all bit set case 
So 4 would be added if this happens
10/09/22, 19:45 - Tejas Warambhe Clg Coder CP: Other way would be to brute force it üòÖ in the end we are considering in terms of bits so 
O(30*2^3) works

Have a look at this solution pretty simple

One of the most underrated website to find Paid Internships,
Apply in as many as you want, make sure your resume is updated and curated as per the requirements 

Many people think they‚Äôll use same resume for every job role but it will reduce your chances significantly.
Change as per roles and requirements as highlighting the skills would help you

You don‚Äôt have to fit in 100% of criteria even 60% match rate is enough to apply for that internship. As a fresher no one is expected to know everything, we all learn on the go.

Hopefully some of you will crack good internships 
Internships even provide PPOs you will be tension free all final year

I‚Äôll give my example, I performed great at my internship and was offered 5.5 lpa PPO(which I rejected for personal reasons).
But it does give you moral boost.

28/12/22, 22:36 - +91 84199 14299: Recently builded this to do list
28/12/22, 22:36 - +91 84199 14299: https://nice-ruby-camel-tux.cyclic.app/
28/12/22, 22:37 - +91 84199 14299: It doesn't have a db tho so the task list aren't saved anywhere that makes it useless üòÖ
28/12/22, 22:38 - +91 84199 14299: I mean it's not saved in any db
28/12/22, 22:38 - Tejas Warambhe Clg Coder CP: You can use Mongodb, learn login/logout, authentication and Authorization 
Then each user can have their unique data
28/12/22, 22:38 - +91 84199 14299: Yeah I'm trying to do that
28/12/22, 22:39 - Tejas Warambhe Clg Coder CP: Np! What did you use to build UI?
28/12/22, 22:39 - +91 84199 14299: Html and css
28/12/22, 22:39 - Tejas Warambhe Clg Coder CP: Great!
What do you want to be specifically? 
Backend/Frontend/Fullstack?
28/12/22, 22:40 - +91 84199 14299: But the design is not completely designed by me I'm not that good in DesignüòÖ
28/12/22, 22:40 - +91 84199 14299: Full stack
28/12/22, 22:40 - Sudipüñ§ Ghosh Div B Clg: You're in which year?
28/12/22, 22:40 - +91 84199 14299: 3
28/12/22, 22:41 - Tejas Warambhe Clg Coder CP: Then it‚Äôs important for you to learn React.js for frontend
Most websites on web are either in PHP or React.js
28/12/22, 22:41 - +91 84199 14299: Yeah I will be learning that ig react is in demand
28/12/22, 22:41 - Sudipüñ§ Ghosh Div B Clg: I see
Then it's time you need to start grinding.
28/12/22, 22:41 - +91 84199 14299: Yeah
28/12/22, 22:41 - Sudipüñ§ Ghosh Div B Clg: Make the most out of this remaining months
28/12/22, 22:41 - +91 84199 14299: Yeah

28/12/22, 22:42 - Sudipüñ§ Ghosh Div B Clg: You want to do full stack in?
28/12/22, 22:42 - +91 84199 14299: Mern
28/12/22, 22:42 - Sudipüñ§ Ghosh Div B Clg: Okay
28/12/22, 22:44 - Tejas Warambhe Clg Coder CP: Coming to backend, make sure your DBMS knowledge is cream
You have to create schemas before developing APIs
If you need any resources to start with let me know
28/12/22, 22:44 - Sudipüñ§ Ghosh Div B Clg: I have recently started with sumit mittal.
Is it a better option?
28/12/22, 22:44 - +91 84199 14299: Any good resources for learning about DBMS I do know SQL but im not that good in fundamentals
28/12/22, 22:45 - Tejas Warambhe Clg Coder CP: Which domain specifically?
28/12/22, 22:45 - Sudipüñ§ Ghosh Div B Clg: SQL
28/12/22, 22:46 - Tejas Warambhe Clg Coder CP: For beginner level SQL if you know basic CRUD (create, read, update, delete) queries, head over to hackerrank SQL section, select EASY filter. And try solving them.
Once you are comfortable, you‚Äôll learn on the job/intern
28/12/22, 22:47 - Tejas Warambhe Clg Coder CP: Yes it‚Äôs good, just a tip open MySQL workbench side by side and practice over a dummy database
28/12/22, 22:47 - +91 84199 14299: Thnx üëç
28/12/22, 22:47 - +91 84199 14299: I do know crud commands
28/12/22, 22:48 - Tejas Warambhe Clg Coder CP: Coming to DBMS, I think for theoretical part, our university book is good enough.
DBMS is the hottest topic in interview, I‚Äôve given many interviews and each and every one of them asked DBMS
28/12/22, 22:48 - Sudipüñ§ Ghosh Div B Clg: For DBMS theoretical
Love Babbar ( *Codehelp*) is also a better option according to me
28/12/22, 22:49 - +91 84199 14299: Yess I watched a few videos of them it was informative
28/12/22, 22:49 - Tejas Warambhe Clg Coder CP: I‚Äôll give an example what a startup would expect from you
Day before yesterday I had a 1 hour interview for backend.
For 20 mins I was asked DBMS questions 
Then he made me open excel sheet and asked me to design database schema for E-commerce application 
Condition:- DO NOT USE ARRAYS
28/12/22, 22:50 - +91 90046 27590: I am in third I find coding difficult how to start with it please help
28/12/22, 22:50 - Tejas Warambhe Clg Coder CP: Let‚Äôs split it up in 2 parts

DSA
Development 

What do you want to start?
28/12/22, 22:51 - +91 84199 14299: Damn
28/12/22, 22:55 - Sudipüñ§ Ghosh Div B Clg: According to you How much important in system Design?
28/12/22, 22:55 - Tejas Warambhe Clg Coder CP: Which year?
28/12/22, 22:55 - Sudipüñ§ Ghosh Div B Clg: Third
28/12/22, 22:55 - +91 91378 93430: Any *Svelte js Developer*
28/12/22, 22:55 - +91 91378 93430: ?
28/12/22, 22:56 - +91 89280 48443: What is the easiest to start with
28/12/22, 22:57 - Tejas Warambhe Clg Coder CP: If your target is product based > 15 LPA, then it‚Äôs necessary to know HLD(high level design) you can skill LLD.
Just to let you know, getting product based interview calls is difficult even with intern experience.
Try to do a GOOD intern, not some spark foundation bs
28/12/22, 22:57 - Sudipüñ§ Ghosh Div B Clg: Got it.
Thanks
28/12/22, 22:58 - +91 91378 93430: Project ideas for Frontend ?
28/12/22, 22:58 - Sudipüñ§ Ghosh Div B Clg: Oh yes and Congratulations for your new position at *Clamp*
28/12/22, 22:59 - Tejas Warambhe Clg Coder CP: Both will consume time, but I‚Äôll suggest you development first so you can build projects which are definitely asked in companies that visit our clg.

For it, you can decide first what you want to learn web or app

Then decide frontend /backend/ fullstack 

@918928048443 just google or watch YouTube videos for today and decide what you want to persue, I‚Äôll guide you on how to start with it.

09/01/23, 20:47 - +91 84199 14299: https://github.com/Anuragmaurya-code/todolist-v2
09/01/23, 20:49 - +91 81045 61330: How this works?
09/01/23, 20:58 - +91 90497 61699: Add new items to your to-do list
09/01/23, 20:58 - +91 90497 61699: Will help you keep track of things you need to do in a day
09/01/23, 21:00 - +91 81045 61330: But why is it like global kind of thing? I mean why do I see the things of others ?
09/01/23, 21:00 - +91 90497 61699: Oh yea
09/01/23, 21:00 - +91 90497 61699: just noticed
09/01/23, 21:01 - +91 90497 61699: yea should have a sign in functionality i guess
09/01/23, 21:01 - +91 81045 61330: No need of sign in, maybe you should check the architecture you're working on
09/01/23, 21:03 - +91 90497 61699: how will he isolate it for each individual user then
09/01/23, 21:06 - +91 81045 61330: You can use local storage like functionality to eliminate the sign in. Else go with sign in if you want to make it available for all devices.

18/01/23, 15:26 - Tejas Warambhe Clg Coder CP: Through clg on-campus tha ye
18/01/23, 15:27 - Tejas Warambhe Clg Coder CP: First round was coding one which was 2 easy-medium problems
18/01/23, 15:28 - Tejas Warambhe Clg Coder CP: Offcampus Media.net SDE role offers 44 LPA CTC for freshers btw
But you have to be extremely good at competitive programming.

19/01/23, 01:13 - Tejas Warambhe Clg Coder CP: Many came, out of which the famous ones I will point (rest are just small orgs or agencies with no brand value and growth in my personal opinion)

Or just ask user what they want. (Just a personal thought)

27/02/23, 11:09 - Tejas Warambhe Clg Coder CP: Take part, I think most of y‚Äôall never did in one.

Some tips :-
Planning is 70% and execution is 30%
The better you plan out what work is gonna be done by whom, the better you‚Äôll perform.

Have a leader who will look into what everyone is doing.

Use github for collaboration (I‚Äôll personally kick you out if I see someone sharing code on telegram along with node modules iykyk)

Focus on features, build more features (you can write a single feature to the best but on paper more features win in hackathons as you have more to sell to the judges)
Quite opposite tbh in real world it takes months to build a feature that‚Äôs robust and scalable.

Use Figma or some UI design tool for making PPTs, if you use power point, god help you lol.
If you wanna be more than mediocre in life push your limits and do more than what‚Äôs been asked (definitely not an advice for academics üòÇ that‚Äôs a waste of time)

Give your best, don‚Äôt get intimidated by competition. 
At SIH our competitor were some IIT Bangalore folks, they had apple macbook pros with 100 stickers on the back of different hackathons they participated in past.

If we underestimated ourselves, t‚Äôwas sure shot a losing game.

SIH coming back soon btw, I need atleast 10 teams winning the screening rounds and qualify for the on-site.

02/03/23, 23:49 - Tejas Warambhe Clg Coder CP: Personal suggestions, if the credits gonna get blown out, have a backup api.

Add the project link to your resume, and don‚Äôt share hostel link publicly, let recruiters use it

09/03/23, 20:40 - +91 91371 77800: There's a difference between being a computer engineer and just being a coder churning up more useless webapps. The latter sadly any codemonkey can do with enough time put in copying code online.

10/03/23, 00:56 - Tejas Warambhe Clg Coder CP: If someone wanna show superiority here, consider flaunting your real world achievements rather than knowledge. It‚Äôs subjective to the stuff we learn and have worked with.

Sadly no one here has hustled enough when it comes to programming other than 1-2 that I know to even have a chance to brag about themselves.
